Robotic_Arm 


This is the code for a Dynamixel Based Robot Arm 

A GAZEBO/ROS simulation has been created for a realistic simulation of a robot arm which was generated from a CAD model of the robot arm.

Various inverse kinematics (IK) libraries have been tested/implemented in simulation primarily using the ROS Package moveit! and a IKpy which is a lightweight python library for inverse kinematics

The real Robot arm is currently still in progress however the Dynamixel ROS API has been implemented to be able to teleoperate the robot arm.
